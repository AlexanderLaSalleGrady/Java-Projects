RedLightMole: Final Project for Advanced Java Programming (CS 2420)

@HowToPlay: To begin the game, the player must
press the start button.  The player will then
have 30 seconds to whack as many moles possible.
After the time has run out the player will NOT
be able to score any more points. If the player
gets a little too excited and hits an empty hole
they will lose one point.  
Each mole has four stages. Up stages allow players to score points. Down stages 
take points away.:
 * 1 Gray = Down
 * 2 Green = Up
 * 3 Red = Up
 * 4 Gray = Down
